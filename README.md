A simple, slightly-better-looking GUI for XMR-Stak built with PyQt5.
## XMR-Stak
This GUI only works with an installation of XMR-Stak, a universal Stratum pool miner that supports CPUs and AMD and NVIDIA GPUs and can be used to mine cryptocurrencies such as Monero and Aeon. Download it [here.](https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak)

### How to use
* Make sure your system has the required dependencies (json, psutil, PyQt5, re, subprocess, sys, time)
* Put the xmr_stak_gui folder and run_xmr_stak_gui.py into the same directory as xmr_stak.exe
* Navigate to the directory and run the command: `python run_xmr_stak_gui`
* Enter pool and wallet address information and click "Start Miner"
